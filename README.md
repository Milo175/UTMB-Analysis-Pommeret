## Introduction to the project <a name="introduction"></a>
Welcome! 

My name is **Milo**, and I am currently in the process of becoming a Data Analyst through self-education. In this project, I analyzed the race results of ultra marathon runner **Ludovic Pommeret** between 08-12-2007 and today. The reason I chose this specific topic is that I am an **ultra marathon enthousiast** and finisher myself. I specifically chose Ludovic as athlete due to the fact that he has both an **impressive and extensive** list of race results to his name.

The **goal** of the project was to practice and further develop my Data Cleaning and Data Analysis skills in **MySQL**.
